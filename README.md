Consider this a Add-On Release since I have only modified the original code to add RP potential.  90% of this script is still
the original author's script with 10% my addition to make players get out and collect bags for RP potential.

The original creator is listed on the copy that I recieved are:


-- ORIGINAL SCRIPT BY Marcio FOR CFX-ESX


Changes to the script:

* added: bag collection to each destination. (driver will have to get out to collect bags from trash bin.)
* added: pay per bag - the more you do the more you earn.
* added: animations from heist "Series A Funding" for walking while holding bag, and putting bag in truck.
* added: check for last job to keep from getting sent to the same job over and over.
